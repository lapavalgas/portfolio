I worked as a consultant at the largest financial institution in Latin America, Ita√∫ Unibanco, where I was involved in anti-fraud systems, internal data distribution, and customer service channels. I hold a professional master's degree in Health Informatics, in which I led a project to computerize neuropsychology in hospital settings, focusing on usability and user experience. I have a passion for working with technology, as I believe in its potential to improve people's lives. As a software engineer, my motivation is to work in engaged teams and contribute to the success of innovative projects. Besides being a software engineer, I am also a psychologist, but that's another story...",
